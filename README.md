# DSP48A1
The Spartan-6 family offers a high ratio of DSP48A1 slices to logic, making it ideal for math-intensive applications. In this repo a hardware description for the Spartan-6 FPGA DSP48A1 Slice using Verilog is added in addition to simulation, synthesis and implementation using VIVADO XILINX.
